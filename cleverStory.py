The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very
{adjective} {animal} {verb1} down the hallway. "{exclamation}!" I yelled. But all
I could think to do was to {verb2} over and over. Miraculously,
that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to {verb3}
right in front of my family.
