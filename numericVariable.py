# quantity_from_user = input("How many items do you have? ")

# # The variable quantity_from_user is a string.
# # To convert it to an integer you use the int(...) notation:
# quantity_number = int(quantity_from_user)

# # Because the quantity_number variable is an integer you can do math with it:
# double_number = quantity_number * 2

# # If you want to use these values in strings, you CANNOT just add them, you first
# # have to convert them to a string:

# # WRONG:
# print("Twice as many is: " + double_number)

# # Right:
# double_string = str(double_number)
# print("Twice as many is: " + double_string)

# # You can also do this in one step:
# # Right:
# print("Twice as many is " + str(double_number))



# # Using two lines:
# people_string = input("How many people are in the room? ")
# people_number = int(people_string)

# # Using one line:
# people_number = int(input("How many people are in the room? "))

# # The same works for floating point numbers:
# length_number = float(input("What is the length? "))
